---------------------------
You did it! You've successfully defeated Necross and escaped the Shadow Realm,
but your celebration is cut short. The moment you cross back to reality, you find
yourself in the familiar halls of Kaiba's Castle. It seems Kaiba’s partnership with
Pegasus was merely a distraction. He has stolen your most powerful cards and
locked them away in his castle to prepare for one last duel. Now, to retrieve your
deck, you must journey through the Grand Hall, the Armory, the Study, the Servants'
Quarters, the Library, and a Secret Passageway all while a ghostly voice that sounds
like Kaiba mocks you from the shadows. To have any chance of victory, you must
retrieve the Blue-Eyes White Dragon Card, Dark Magician, Monster Reborn,
Polymerization, Pot of Greed, and Change of Heart cards. Once you have reclaimed
your deck, find Kaiba in his lair and duel for your freedom!
